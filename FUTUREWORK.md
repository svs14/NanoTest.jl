# Future Work

Listed below are the key features that are to be developed:

- Extendable API and configuration (plugin-oriented architecture)
- Behaviour Driven Development (BDD)
- Parallel test execution
- Markdown example code runner
- Code coverage thresholding
- Code style thresholding (e.g. lint)
- Code analysis thresholding (e.g. function code complexity)
- Benchmark thresholding (e.g. estimated asymptotic complexity, relative timings)
- Fixtures (e.g. mocks/stubs/spies)
- Stochastic software testing
- Specification based random testing (e.g. QuickCheck in Haskell)
